## Description
This is a simple React application that generates and displays a random piece of advice from [AdviceSlipAPI](https://api.adviceslip.com/). The button that allows users to fetch another random piece of advice. This was a [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge.

## Motivation

I wanted to hone my skills on using React Hooks and API calls and HTTP requests and responses to dynamically display data.

## Accomplishments

- A deeper understanding of useState and useEffect hooks
- CSS effects
- Following a wireframe and mock up
- API request practice!
- Successful Unit Tests
